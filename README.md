# Word Hunt Solver!
By Serah Park

## Description
A foolproof way to win a round of Word Hunt, a popular iMessage game (or alternatively, Boggle)! The game is played by finding words through connecting adjacent letters. This solver generates the best valid words that can be matched on a 4x4 Word Hunt board. It utilizes a recursive depth-first search algorithm that compares word prefixes with the 2019 Collins Scrabble Words dictionary to eliminate paths that won't generate valid words. 

## How to play
To play, download wordHuntSolver.java, serahCow.java, and words_list.txt. Once you compile & run wordHuntSolver.java, you can input letters according to your game board to generate the list of best words! Note, the dictionary used by GamePigeon's Word Hunt may differ slightly from the Scrabble dictionary, so some words may not be valid.
